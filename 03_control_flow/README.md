# Control Flow

This folder contains beginner-level Python projects focused on understanding and implementing control flow structures. These projects build on foundational Python skills and reinforce key concepts such as conditional statements, nested conditions, logical operators, and decision-making processes.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Rollercoaster
Determine if a user can ride a rollercoaster based on height requirements and calculate ticket prices based on age and photo options.

### 2. Pizza Delivery
Calculate the total cost of a pizza order based on size, pepperoni, and extra cheese selections using conditional logic.

### 3. Treasure Island
An interactive text-based adventure game where users navigate through multiple decision points to find treasure. Features 6 different challenges with various outcomes.

### 4. ATM Withdrawal Simulator
Simulate an ATM withdrawal process with balance validation, insufficient funds checking, and invalid amount handling using nested conditions.

### 5. Password Strength Checker
Check password strength based on length, presence of uppercase letters, and digits using conditional logic and string methods.

### 6. Leap Year Validator
Determine if a year is a leap year using the Gregorian calendar rules with proper order of precedence (400, 100, 4 divisibility rules).

### 7. Quiz Score Grader
Convert numeric scores (0-100) into letter grades (A, B, C, D, F) using chained if/elif statements with appropriate grade ranges.

### 8. Number Guessing Hint Game
Interactive guessing game that provides hints (exact match, very close, too high/low) using random number generation and absolute difference calculations.

## Key Control Flow Concepts Covered

- **Conditional Statements**: Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` for decision making
- **Nested Conditions**: Implementing conditions within conditions for complex logic
- **Logical Operators**: Working with `and`, `or`, and `not` operators
- **Input Validation**: Checking user input and handling edge cases
- **Multiple Decision Points**: Creating branching paths based on user choices
- **Error Handling**: Managing invalid inputs and edge cases gracefully

## How to Run These Projects

- Each project is implemented as a standalone Python script.
- Use Python 3 to run each script in a terminal or IDE like PyCharm.
- Example:  
  ```bash
  python3 01_rollercoaster.py
  ```
- Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
- Navigate to the project folder before running the scripts.
