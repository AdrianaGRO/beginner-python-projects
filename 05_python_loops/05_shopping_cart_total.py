# 5. Shopping Cart Total - Calculate total cost using loops
# Uses loops to iterate through item prices and calculate running total
# Demonstrates accumulator pattern with addition and real-world application
# Shows how loops can process lists of prices for practical scenarios

# Project Instructions:
# Create a shopping cart system that calculates the total cost
# Use a list of item prices and loop through them to sum the total
# Add features like tax calculation, discount application, or item counting
# Display the final total with proper formatting

# Example item prices:
# prices = [2.50, 15.99, 8.75, 3.25, 12.00, 5.99]
# Expected output: "Total: $48.48"

# Bonus challenges:
# - Add item names with corresponding prices
# - Calculate tax (e.g., 8.5%)
# - Apply discounts for bulk purchases
# - Show individual items with running total

# TODO: Implement your solution here
