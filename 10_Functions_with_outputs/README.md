# 10_Functions_with_outputs

## Overview
This folder contains beginner-friendly Python projects focused on writing and using functions that return values. Each project demonstrates a different use case for functions with outputs, helping to build foundational programming skills.

## Projects in This Folder
- **01_format_name.py**: Formats a name string (e.g., capitalizes first and last names).
- **02_is_palindrome.py**: Checks if a string is a palindrome.
- **03_max_of_three.py**: Returns the maximum of three numbers.
- **04_sum_list.py**: Sums all numbers in a list using a function.
- **05_double_text.py**: Doubles the input text string.
- **06_to_title_case.py**: Converts a string to title case.
- **07_combined_string_formatter.py**: Combines and formats multiple strings.
- **08_leap_year.py**: Checks if a given year is a leap year.
- **09_calculator.py**: Performs basic arithmetic operations using functions.
- **10_temperature_converter.py**: Converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin, with a history feature and dictionary-based function lookup.

## Key Concepts Covered
- Writing functions with return values
- Using dictionaries to store and call functions
- Function composition and chaining
- Floating-point precision and formatting
- Managing program state (e.g., conversion history)
- Testing functions with hard-coded values

## How to Use
Each script is self-contained and can be run independently. For educational purposes, most scripts use hard-coded test values instead of user input. This approach helps focus on function logic and output verification.

## Example: Temperature Converter
The `10_temperature_converter.py` project demonstrates advanced use of functions, including:
- Six temperature conversion functions
- Dictionary mapping for dynamic function lookup
- Conversion history tracking and display
- All temperature displays formatted to one decimal place with units

## Getting Started
1. Open any `.py` file in this folder to explore the code and logic.
2. Run the script in your Python environment to see the output.
3. Modify the hard-coded test values to experiment with different scenarios.

*Happy coding!*
