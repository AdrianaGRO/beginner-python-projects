# Random Lists & Randomization

This folder contains beginner-level Python projects focused on understanding and implementing randomization concepts and list manipulation. These projects build on foundational Python skills and reinforce key concepts such as random number generation, list operations, sampling techniques, and probability-based programming.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Random Heads or Tails
Simple coin flip simulator using `random.randint(0, 1)` to generate either heads or tails with equal 50/50 probability.

### 2. Banker Roulette
Random person selector that uses `random.choice()` to pick one person from a list of friends to pay the bill. Demonstrates random selection from predefined lists.

### 3. Rock Paper Scissors
Classic game implementation with random computer opponent using `random.randint(0, 2)`. Features ASCII art for visual representation and complete game logic with win/lose/draw conditions.

### 4. Treasure Chest Randomizer
Random treasure generator that creates surprise loot combinations using multiple randomization techniques to simulate opening treasure chests in games.

### 5. Random Password Generator
Secure password creation tool that randomly combines letters, numbers, and symbols to generate strong passwords of varying lengths using `random.choice()` and list manipulation.

### 6. Quiz Question Picker
Interactive quiz game with score tracking that randomly selects questions from a pool without repetition. Uses parallel lists for questions and answers, implements index management to prevent duplicates, and provides performance feedback.

### 7. Name/Team Selector
Professional team building tool that randomly selects team members from user-provided lists using `random.sample()`. Features user-friendly interface with emojis, input validation, and proper error handling for team formation scenarios.

## Key Randomization Concepts Covered

- **Random Number Generation**: Using `random.randint()` for integer ranges and probability simulation
- **Random Selection**: Implementing `random.choice()` for single item selection from lists
- **Random Sampling**: Using `random.sample()` for multiple unique selections without replacement
- **List Manipulation**: Creating, modifying, and processing lists with random elements
- **Index Management**: Tracking and removing used indices to prevent repetition
- **Parallel Lists**: Managing corresponding data across multiple lists using shared indices
- **Input Processing**: Splitting user input, cleaning whitespace, and formatting data
- **Probability Simulation**: Creating fair random outcomes and equal distribution
- **User Experience Design**: Implementing professional interfaces with emojis and clear messaging

## Advanced Features Demonstrated

- **No Repetition Logic**: Ensuring unique selections in multi-round scenarios
- **Score Tracking**: Maintaining state across multiple iterations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful management of edge cases and invalid inputs
- **String Manipulation**: Processing and formatting user-provided text data
- **Case-Insensitive Comparisons**: User-friendly input handling
- **Professional UI**: Marketing-focused messaging and visual appeal

## How to Run These Projects

- Each project is implemented as a standalone Python script.
- Use Python 3 to run each script in a terminal or IDE like PyCharm.
- Example:  
  ```bash
  python3 06_quiz_question_picker.py
  ```
- Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
- Navigate to the project folder before running the scripts.
- Some projects require user input, so run them interactively for the best experience.
