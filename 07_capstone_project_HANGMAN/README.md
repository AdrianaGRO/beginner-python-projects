# Py Hangman: Python-Themed Capstone Project

Welcome to **Py Hangman** – a Python-themed twist on the classic game! 
## 🐍 Project Highlights
- Randomly selects a Python-related word for each game.
- Custom ASCII art and logo for a unique experience.
- Repeated guesses do NOT cost a life.
- Each incorrect guess draws part of the hangman.
- Correct guesses reveal all matching letters at once.

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced
- For and while loops
- If, elif, and else statements
- Lists, strings, and user input
- Python modules and imports
- Defensive programming (input validation, repeated guess handling)

## 🚀 How to Play
1. Run `hangman_project.py` in your terminal or IDE.
2. Guess letters to reveal the hidden Python word.
3. Each wrong guess costs a life and draws part of the hangman.
4. Repeated guesses are safe – no penalty!
5. Win by guessing all letters before you run out of lives.
