## Key Dictionary & Nesting Concepts Covered

- **Dictionary Syntax**: Understanding `{key: value}` structure and proper usage
- **Key Lookup**: Accessing and updating values by key
- **Nesting Structures**: Combining lists and dictionaries for complex data
- **Data Mapping**: Transforming one set of values to another using dictionaries
- **Formatted Output**: Using f-Strings for professional results
- **Code Organization**: Structuring code for readability and maintainability
- **Testing with Hard-Coded Values**: Using sample calls instead of input() for reliable testing

## Advanced Features Demonstrated

- **Nested Data Access**: Handling dictionaries within lists and vice versa
- **Data Transformation**: Mapping scores to grades, restructuring data
- **Edge Case Handling**: Robust logic for missing keys or empty structures
- **Professional Code Structure**: Clean, readable, and maintainable programming patterns
- **User Experience Design**: Clear output formats and helpful messages
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient data processing for better program performance

## How to Run These Projects

- Each project is implemented as a standalone Python script.
- Use Python 3 to run each script in a terminal or IDE like PyCharm.
- Example:  
  ```bash
  python3 09_grading_program.py
  ```
- Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
- Navigate to the project folder before running the scripts.
- All projects use hard-coded values for testing, so no user input is required.
