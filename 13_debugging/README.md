# Top 10 Practical Debugging Tips for Python

1. **Read Error Messages Carefully**
   - Python's error messages often tell you exactly what's wrong and where. Don't ignore them!

2. **Use Print Statements**
   - Add `print()` statements to check variable values and program flow at different points.

3. **Check for Typos**
   - Misspelled variable names, missing colons, or incorrect indentation are common sources of bugs.

4. **Test with Simple Inputs**
   - Use small, simple test cases to isolate and reproduce bugs easily.

5. **Comment Out Code**
   - Temporarily comment out sections to narrow down where the problem occurs.

6. **Use a Debugger**
   - Tools like VS Code's built-in debugger or Python's `pdb` let you step through code line by line.

7. **Check Data Types**
   - Make sure variables are the type you expect (e.g., string vs. integer).

8. **Review Function Arguments and Returns**
   - Double-check that functions receive and return the correct values.

9. **Watch for Mutable Default Arguments**
   - Avoid using mutable types (like lists) as default arguments in functions.

10. **Take Breaks and Ask for Help**
    - Sometimes stepping away or explaining your problem to someone else (or a rubber duck!) helps you see the solution.

Happy Debugging!
