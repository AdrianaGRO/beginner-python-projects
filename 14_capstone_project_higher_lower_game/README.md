# Higher Lower Game (Capstone Project)

This is a Python implementation of the classic "Higher Lower" game. The player is presented with two options (A and B), each representing a famous person or entity with a certain number of followers. The goal is to guess which one has more followers. The game continues as long as the player guesses correctly, and the score increases with each correct answer.

## How to Play
1. Run `main.py` in this folder.
2. For each round, compare the two options and type 'A' or 'B' to guess who has more followers.
3. The game ends when you make a wrong guess. Your final score will be displayed.

## Files
- `main.py`: Main game logic.
- `data_game.py`: Contains the data for the game (list of options).
- `art.py`: Contains ASCII art for the game logo and VS symbol.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required (uses only the standard library).
